# CSCI467FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI467 -- cell segmentation

baseline_dapi algorithm is a basic thresholding algorithm
kmeans is a mini-batch k-means algorithm
machinealg is a convolutional neural network algorithm

Dataset: https://deepseas.org/datasets/
Note: The DeepSea dataset has a lot of images, but not all of them have a correct mask pair, so I only used the images with a paired mask (so my training dataset was smaller than what they provided).
